This is a beefed-up version of my more simple [CSV logger](/posts/unity-csv-logger-for-experiments/) packagae I previously released, focusing on doing the difficult management of different stages of an experiment that are usually cumbersome. It also crucially alows for multithreaded File I/O which is especially important in VR applications where we can not afford for frame times to exceed the target.
